# Branch Guide

> **Basically, it has one branch called master/main.**
>
> **The reason for creating a branch is to do a different work from what you are working on now or to have your own space (study).**
>
> **You can PR by pushing from a non-default branch.**
>
> **It is possible to test and experiment with the function to be developed through the branch for each component.**
>
> **It is okay to create a branch and delete it when it becomes obsolete (when it is merged into the master, when it is not used, etc.)**
>
> **It is always necessary to check whether the branch to work with is currently connected (refer to the PR guide)**

### master Branch Tip
> **All developments in the master should be reviewed and stored.**
> 
> **The master is comfortable to think of as a finished version.**
