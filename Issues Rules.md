# Why write an issue

- Use issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub
- You can collect user feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks you'd like to accomplish with issues in a repository
- You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.



# Create issue(default)
- It can be created from the github repository.

Issues can include a title and a description of the issue.

## create label

> Label option  
The generated issues seem difficult to manage in the form of a list.  
What if there are too many issues?  
It will be difficult to find specific issues.   
To improve this problem, we use the Label function.  
Through labeling for each issue, you can search for issues and classify topics for each issue.

![label](https://yagom.net/wp-content/uploads/hm_bbpui/7448/hgfte6t104cxay1hht9w5k9cpklku5af.png)

- In the issue detail page, you can designate the issue as the created label.

**Labels should be used as a basis for dividing the priority of issues, categories, and other useful information.**


## Assigness

- Assignees can be assigned to the issue.

> If you look at the list of issues after assigning a label and a person in charge, you can see that it is neatly organized.  
You can search for issues by filtering in the Filters field through the designated label and assignee.  
However, even if Label and Assignee are assigned, similar issues exist for each function, and in order to find related issues or figure out how much of the corresponding functions are implemented, it is necessary to track them day by day.
